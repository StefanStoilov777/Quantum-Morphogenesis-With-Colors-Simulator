# Quantum-Morphogenesis-With-Colors-Simulator
A dynamic, interactive simulation of a **quantum-inspired automaton** evolving over time. This system models emergent behaviors using **quantum-like rules**, environmental noise, and entanglement effects.

## Features
- 🧬 **Quantum-Inspired Cellular Automaton**  
- 🔬 **40 Evolution Rules** influencing matter creation, entanglement, and decay  
- 🌌 **Procedural Noise Integration** using OpenSimplex for environmental dynamics  
- 🎨 **Real-Time Visualization** with PyQt5 and PyQtGraph  
- ⚙️ **Interactive Parameter Control Panel**  

## Installation

### Requirements  
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the simulator

```sh
python Quantum_Morphogenesis_Simulator.py
```

## Dependencies  
This project uses the following libraries:
- `numpy` – Numerical operations
- `PyQt5` – GUI framework
- `pyqtgraph` – Fast visualization
- `opensimplex` – Procedural noise generation

## How It Works
- Cells interact based on **quantum-like neighborhood rules**  
- Random environmental noise affects **field strength and gravity**  
- Cells **decay over time** unless they meet survival criteria  
- Quantum fluctuations generate **organic, crystal, and abstract structures**  

## Controls  
- Adjust parameters like **mutation rate**, **gravity**, and **quantum flux** in the right panel  
- Watch as new structures emerge from the quantum vacuum  
- Patterns **evolve dynamically** based on 40 quantum rules that are generated based on perameters
